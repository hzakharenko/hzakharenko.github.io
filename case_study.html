        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>The product outlined in this case study was created by Hanna Zakharenko, G Goodwin, and Jorge Argueta in INST406 at the University of Maryland in Spring 2023. The product was started on February 6, 2023 and the final product was presented in class on May 2, 2023. This case study summarizing our work was completed on May 7, 2023. I primarily focused on the UX design of the application while also helping my other team members learn how to use Figma to create a high fidelity phone application with movement. If you are interested in looking at a specific stage of our process, you can view the following sections: <a class = "page-jumps" href = "#background">Background</a>, <a class = "page-jumps" href = "#development">Development and Iterations</a>, <a class = "page-jumps" href = "#final">Final Product</a>, and <a class = "page-jumps" href = "#future"> the Future of SportsCourts</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
        <p>SportsCourts came to life in a class session. Our design group, consisting of three people, was prompted to design a screen-based product using a drawing from <a href="https://situationlab.org/project/the-thing-from-the-future/" target="_blank">“The Thing From the Future”</a>. We were given the following restrictions: a time span of a couple of years in the future, a focus on “court,” and an emotion to convey— “rationality.” </p>
        <p>We started our session by throwing up any and all ideas onto a whiteboard. With our focus on “courts,” we leaned towards ideas about government, specifically legal courts. We also explored other contexts for the word, including sports.</p>
        <center><img src="img/whiteboard.png" width="70%"></center>
        <p>After deliberating over our favorite ideas, we decided to design an app that helps you book local sports courts in your area and chose a name for it— SportsCourts. The concept was filled with opportunities— it was a tool that didn't currently exist at large, it seemed fun to design, and it fit within the constraints of our prompt.</p>
        <center><img src="img/sportscourts.png" width="50%"></center>
        <p>Next, we drafted a few essential features and basic wireframes. Our initial wireframes focused on a few core features: the ability to book a court, the ability to play on that court alone, with friends or with strangers; the ability to message people through the app, and the ability to connect with your local sports community (e.g., view local leaderboard scores).</p>

        <h3 id="development">Development and Iterations</h3>
        <p>Over the course of the semester, our application went through multiple iterations. After presenting our design in a class critique session, we changed and added features to our app as it transitioned from basic wireframes to a high-fidelity prototype. Using online resources and Playo, a similar app used outside of the U.S., we added a notification feature, changed our home screen to a card view, and integrated our calendar feature into the booking process.</p>
        <img src="img/second iteration.png" width="100%">
        <p>We wanted to put our users and their ability to connect to each other at the center of our design. We developed user personas, a slogan and other key features to give the screen design complexity and help us think about how different people might use the app.</p>

        <h3 id="final">Final Product</h3>
        <p>Our final product reflects these key features. Users start on a home page that allows them to search for courts they want, to filter out courts they don’t want, or to view courts in their area using a card or map view. Users can also see essential metadata about each court before booking, view available dates and times, and invite friends to the court or make it open for anyone to join. Users can indicate their sport and skill level in their profile to find other users with similar skills.</p>
        <p>Users can also chat in-app. This allows for safer communication for individuals who want to play a game together, but don’t necessarily want to or need to exchange phone numbers. On the user profile page, users can see their upcoming reservations and how their own teams are performing within their league.</p>

        <h3 id="future">The Future of SportsCourts</h3>
        <p>SportsCourts is the beginning of a new, online sports community that allows users to connect to friends and coaches, meet new people, find new courts to play on, try out new things, join a recreational team, and more. We imagine the app as a home base for local sports teams, private coaches, and local sports organizations to book courts, find players, and communicate.</p>
        <p>It’s important to note that we were limited within the time span of this class to work on our design. While we want our design to serve as a flawless online sports community and booking app, we have focused on a couple of the most important features for this class as an example of what the app could be.</p>
        <p>Our ideal UX design would show more of the features that open our app to different people within the sports community. For example, we want coaches to be able to host and reserve their lessons on the app. We also want teams to be able to communicate within the app about upcoming practices and games.</p>
        <p>Our app has the potential to serve a large community and serve it well. SportsCourts provides resources that are currently spread out across the internet. Allowing users to meet people, book courts, and engage with others on teams and coaching in one place will save users time and money, allowing them to spend more time doing what they love— playing sports.</p>

        I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, majoring in Journalism and Information Science. I write food stories for Spoon University, and write and read pop-culture stories on-air at WMUC 88.1FM. I've done research in behavioral transportation sciences and in sustainability analytics.

        Recently, I've been thinking about: driver distration and HCI interaction, climate justice and graphics. Talk to me about any of these!
